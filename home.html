      <h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such 
        as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used 
        by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data
        centers and other computerized systems.
        A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against malicious 
        attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's 
        systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks 
        that aim to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.

      <h1>Threats in Cyber Security</h1>
      <h3>Most Common Types of Cyber Security Threats</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Malware </strong> - Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. 
        Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which 
        leads to installing dangerous software. Cisco reports that malware, once activated, can:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Emotet</strong> - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) describes Emotet 
        as “an advanced, modular banking Trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other 
        banking Trojans. Emotet continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Denial of Service</strong> - A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a computer 
        or network so it can’t respond to requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates 
        from a computer network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Man in the Middle</strong> - A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves 
        into a two-party transaction. After interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Phishing</strong> - Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening 
        it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data like 
        credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine,” Cisco reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Sql Injection</strong> - A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber attack that results from 
        inserting malicious code into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information. Submitting the malicious 
        code can be as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search box.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Password Attacks</strong> - With the right password, a cyber attacker has access to a wealth of information.
        Other types of password attacks include accessing a password database or outright guessing.

      <h1>Cyber Security Management Strategies</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Create a security system:</strong> Unlike traditional administrative structures where operations and enforcement of 
        rules are handled from the top-down, creating a security system using your human capital will need to be organized from the bottom-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Increase your employee skillset:</strong> Your cybersecurity is only as strong as its weakest link. 
        Regularly train your team on the latest IT best practices. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Backup your data:</strong> Just like the best YouTubers constantly create backups of video footage they record, you need 
        to constantly backup your organization’s data. Always backup your data, files and any electronic information that is vital to your 
        business as well as the most recent drafts/iterations of projects your team is working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Put the cloud to work:</strong> Although the cloud still has its risks, you are less likely to lose critical data by saving 
        data to the cloud. Using the cloud for data storage is an economical option for small to mid-sized businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Invest in your IT infrastructure:</strong> Install antivirus programs and firewalls on your computers. Firewalls will discourage 
        the average cybercriminal seeking to do damage your company. Regularly update your computer security systems. Don’t be shy when 
        it comes to investing in your IT infrastructure.
